# The purpose of this library is to consolidate common functions used in each
# "application".  For example, the flux function for each "advection"
# application remains the same, the usual thing one wishes to modify are the
# initial conditions.

# LIBRARY for 1D ADVECTION

# For these problems, we'll use a common ConSoln function.  
# This tests for mass, L1-norm, L2-norm and Linf-norm.
ConSoln     = $(APP_LIB)/ConSoln

# Flux function, and its derivatives
FluxFunc    = $(APP_LIB)/FluxFunc

# These time derivatives are required for the Lax-Wendroff (and
# two-derivative) code:
