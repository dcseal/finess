# The purpose of this library is to consolidate common functions used in each
# "application".  For example, the flux function for each "advection"
# application remains the same, the usual thing one wishes to modify are the
# initial conditions.

# LIBRARY for 1D ADVECTION

APP_NAME  = advection
APP_LIB   = $(FINESS)/apps/1d/$(APP_NAME)/lib

# Flux function, and its derivatives
FluxFunc    = $(APP_LIB)/FluxFunc

# These time derivatives are required for the Lax-Wendroff (and
# two-derivative) code:
DFluxFunc   = $(APP_LIB)/DFluxFunc
D2FluxFunc  = $(APP_LIB)/D2FluxFunc

# Eigen decomposition of the Flux function

ProjectRightEig  = $(APP_LIB)/ProjectRightEig

# Wave speed functions
