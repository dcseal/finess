# The purpose of this library is to consolidate common functions used in each
# "application".  For example, the flux function for each "advection"
# application remains the same, the usual thing one wishes to modify are the
# initial conditions.

# LIBRARY for 2D ADVECTION

# Flux function, and its derivatives

# These time derivatives are required for the Lax-Wendroff (and
# two-derivative) code:
DFluxFunc   = $(APP_LIB)/DFluxFunc

# Eigen decomposition of the Flux function
ProjectLeftEig   = $(APP_LIB)/ProjectLeftEig

# Auxilary function 
# (not included here, because this defines the advection speeds for each
# individual application)

# AuxFunc     = $(APP_LIB)/AuxFunc
