# Default (blank) templates

This is a collection of potential templates in the [1d](../README.md) branch
of [FINESS](../../../README.md) that can be used for each application.  It is
advisable that the user copies an existing application in place of copying or
modifying these.

The code assumes that each of these function have been defined in order to
compile.  For a working example, please visit the application directory.

IT IS STRONGLY ENCOURAGED TO WORK FROM EXISTING EXAMPLES AS OPPOSED TO COPYING
ROUTINES FROM THIS LOCATION.
